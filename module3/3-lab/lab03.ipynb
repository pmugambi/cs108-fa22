    "A *list* is another Python sequence type, similar to an array. It's different than an array because the values it contains can all have different types. A single list can contain `int` values, `float` values, and strings. Elements in a list can even be other lists! A list is created by giving a name to the list of values enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas. For example, `values_with_different_types = ['190', F, ['lab', 3]]`\n",
